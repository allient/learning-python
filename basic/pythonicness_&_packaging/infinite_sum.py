Function Arguments


Given a function that takes 2 arguments and returns their sum.
But we get an error when we want to sum more than 2 numbers. Change the function and complete the code so that the function sums as many numbers as are input.

*args are accessible as the tuple args in the body of the function, so you can iterate through its items.
